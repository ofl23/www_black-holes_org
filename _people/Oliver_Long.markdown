Numerical modelling of unbound binary black hole encounters

##### Biography

My name is Oliver Long and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Potsdam, Germany. Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Southampton in 2022 and earned my MPhys in Physics from The University of Manchester in 2018.

My research focuses on the numerical modelling of unbound binary black hole encounters. These high-energy systems allow us to probe the ultra-strong gravitational potential and increase our understanding of General Relativity. To explore these systems, I employ a range of methods, including Numerical Relativity for the comparable mass case and self-force techniques from black hole perturbation theory for extreme-mass ratio scenarios.
